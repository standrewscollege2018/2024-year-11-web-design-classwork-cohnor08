        </p>

        <h2>United Kingdom
        </h2>
        
        <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!
        </p>
        <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.

        <h2>Greece</h2>

        <p>Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals.
        </p>

        <p>We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.

        <h2>France</h2>

        <p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.
        </p>
        <p>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.
        </p>
        <p>We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.
